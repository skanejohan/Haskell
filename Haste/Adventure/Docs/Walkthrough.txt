Part 1 - finding the entrance to the underground
------------------------------------------------
Go to the kitchen
Open the cupboard
Take the cup. A key is revealed.
Take the key
Go to the history section
Unlock the office door with the key
Open the door
Go to the office

Open the safe (combination 1979, as per the plaque in the outer room, although there should be many red herrings in the office)
In the safe you find a book about the house in what is presumably latin.
Take the book
Go to the travel and language section
Examine the language bookshelf - a latin dictionary is revealed (since you hold the old book)
Get the latin dictionary
Now examine the book about the house - this reveals the secret - a secret door in the eastern wall of what is now the history section.

Go to the history section
Remove the books from the shelf on the eastern side of the room. This reveals an old brick wall.

Go to the office
In the desk are a number of things, get the paper clip.
There is a large cupboard filled with a lot of stuff. Get the small metal box - you remember it from your childhood... stamps? your stone collection?
Examine the metal box. This reveals its lock.
Pick the lock with the paper clip and open the box.
It contains your old stone collection. Examine the stones. This reveals a small axe (term?).
Get the small axe. 

Go to the history section
As you are about to strike the wall, the bell at the front door rings and you move to the fiction section. 
It is your rich uncle (you need his money, so you don't want to strike the wall while he is here)
Go to the kitchen
Make some tea
Give the tea to your uncle.
Your uncle drinks the tea, then excuses himself and disappears into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.

Go to the history section
Strike the wall with the small axe. A door is revealed.
Open the door and enter.
